# ApacheIgnite-Hibernate

* Apache Ignite  is a memory-centric distributed database, caching, and processing platform for transactional, analytical, and streaming workloads delivering in-memory speeds at petabyte scale. To get more information and download Apache Ignite [here](https://ignite.apache.org/)

This is simple example about caching in the Apache Ignite with Hibernate.

**Note that:** ignite-hibernate is a lgpl dependency. Therefore it is not in the maven central repository. To get more information [here](http://ignite.apache.org/download.cgi#build-source)

Before run the example because of I have used postgres as database, you should change the hibernate configuration as your needs. 

If you do not want to change, follow the step described [here](https://github.com/mehmetozanguven/ApacheIgnite-Caching/edit/master/README.md)


I have also put the jar file **ApacheIgniteWithHibernate-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar**. 

Create the database and run the jar file `java -jar ApacheIgniteWithHibernate-1.0-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar`
